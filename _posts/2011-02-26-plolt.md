title: Interactive Plotting with Node.js
---

A near-indespensable part of any scientific programming environment is an
interactive plotting tool. For example, MATLAB and Octave have
[plot()](http://www.mathworks.com/help/techdoc/ref/plot.html) and friends, 
python has [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/), R has its share of
plotting tools, and such things as excel and [vtk](http://www.vtk.org/) are
often used alongside environments that don't lend themselves very well to the
whole "exploratory programming" thing.

Most of the time, plotting in javascript is used for real-time dashboard type
stuff. For example, a lot of people throw
[smoothie charts](http://smoothiecharts.org/) up and plot data streams for
real-time monitoring of things like CPU usage and temperature and what-not.
Pretty awesome, but not quite what I wanted.  So, I took a few hours, learned
me some new tools, and built what I'm calling "Plolt."

## Plotting library: Flotr

For the plotting library, after some research I chose
[flotr](http://solutoire.com/flotr/). There are a metric ass-ton of plotting
libraries out there, but flotr was one that met my needs:

1. Plots to either SVG or canvas. [Flot](https://code.google.com/p/flot/) fails this one because it uses standard DOM objects to make its plots. This means, for example, that a y-label is out of the question.

2. Has decent documentation. This is where [g.raphael](https://github.com/DmitryBaranovskiy/g.raphael) fails. This is probably because the author hasn't really had the time to polish up the g.raphael project. This is a shame, because I love raphael.

2. Has good support for scatter plots. [Grafico](https://github.com/Kilian/grafico) fails here, because it primarily supports line plots. This is a shame, because its plots look dead sexy, and I love raphael.

3. Has a *sane API* for simple scatter plots. [CanvasXPress](http://www.canvasxpress.org/) makes really pretty plots, but its support for simple 2-d and 3-d data is lacking, as it was designed to work primarily with annotated data. So, it fails. That said, its 3D plot may be the best solution out there for 3-d that I've seen.

4. Doesn't try to make things look TOO flashy. If the authors mention [Edward Tufte](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Edward_Tufte), that's usually a good sign. As an aside, I think readers of Tufte might cargo cult it up a bit, though.

## Serving Up Plots with Express and Jade

I decided to give Express a shot. I've been meaning to for a while! It turns
out that Express is pretty easy. The Express part of the code looks, basically,
like this:

    var app = express.createServer();

    app.use(express.staticProvider(__dirname) );
    app.set('views', __dirname);

    app.get('/', function(req, res) {
        res.render('index.jade', {layout: false});
    });

You can see that it's *PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD* in terms of javascript. All I did
was set up a few options and told it to serve up html generated with jade, from
index.jade, when people visited the site's root. Awesome!

It turns out Jade isn't too bad for HTML, either. It has its warts like
everything else (for example, 2-space indents instead of 4-space ;) ), but all
in all it's helpful.  The Jade code looks like this:

    !!! 5
    html(lang="en")
      head
        title="roflol"
        script(type="text/javascript",src="js/prototype.js")
        script(type="text/javascript",src="js/flotr.js")
        script(type="text/javascript",src="dnode.js")
        script(type="text/javascript",src="client.js")
      body
        h1 THIS IS THE REMIX
        #remix(style="width:640px;height:480px;")
          p RIGHT HERE BUDDY

I wasn't very professional when I made this, I'll admit.  I wish there was a
cleaner way to do script stuff in Jade, but I'm not complaining too much.
Anyways: All this really does is add a title ("THIS IS THE REMIX") and a
div called "remix" with a paragraph in it with some filler text.

## Using DNode for Page/Server Communication:

This part was ripped pretty much directly from SubStack's wonderful article on
[Ad-Hoc Pubsubs with DNode](http://substack.net/posts/9bac3e/Roll-your-own-PubSub-with-DNode).
I have to admit that the x.bind() magic still trips me out a bit. But,
conceptually, all we did was make the web page subscribe for updates on data, in
the form of arguments to Flotr.draw():

    //This is in client.js
    document.observe('dom:loaded', function() {
        DNode.connect(function(server) {
            var emitter = new EventEmitter;

            emitter.on('data', function(xy,opts) {
                Flotr.draw($('remix'), xy, opts);
            });

            server.subscribe(function() {
                emitter.emit.apply(emitter, arguments);
            });
        });
    });

If you've read SubStack's article, this should look very familiar, save for the
Flotr.draw() line.

## Using DNode for Server/REPL Communication:

DNode was used a *second* time to make RPCs from the REPL to the Express app.
This is in a module called "plolt.js" :

    //plolt.js
    var DNode = require('dnode');

    module.exports = function(xy, opts) {
        DNode.connect(6061, function(server) {
            server.plot(xy, opts);
        });
    }

and this is in the server that hosts the Express app:

    //server.js
    DNode(function() {
        this.plot = function(xy, args) {
            publish('data', xy, args);
        }
    }).listen(6061);

Basically, sending arguments to the plolt.js module uses DNode to communicate
with the running server. Interestingly enough, this mirrors the approach that
[ipython](http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/) uses---that is, ipython runs what's
necessary to render matplotlib plots in another thread, and uses ipc's to allow
one to generate a plot in ipython and continue going. This is why one must call
*ipython --pylab* in order to use matplotlib without a bunch of heartache. Or,
at least, this is my understanding.

## The Exciting Part: Use!

Here's a screenshot showing everything in all its glory:

[![](http://i.imgur.com/ZVqN6.png)](http://imgur.com/ZVqN6)

The top window shows the server running. The bottom window shows the REPL, and
the call to plot(). The browser window shows whatever you last told it to plot
via the plot() call.

## What next?

This is obviously just a proof of concept. What would make this MORE BADASS?
Here are some of my ideas:

* Exposure of more of the plotting API.

* A prettier web page, with more meaningful text.

* image-based output. If one were using a svg-based lib, you would already have
them in vector-based format, which is technically superior for plots.

* The ability to have multiple figures at once. In fact, you could make all
figures (semi-permanent) and have the call to plot() return a url with a key
identifier (a la imgur).

I'm sure there are others. I'm sure I'll be really slow to implement any of
them, if I ever do. But you know it'd be badass!

## Try it yourself!

Get the source code here: <https://github.com/jesusabdullah/plolt>

In order to run the server, you will need DNode, Express, Jade and underscore,
and all the dependencies those require.  If you have npm, it should be easy
to install all of them. In fact, you should be able to use npm with the included
package.json, though it's untested.

Happy plotting!
