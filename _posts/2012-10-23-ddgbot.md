Daang, it's been a while, hasn't it? Last blog post is over 6 months old! This
one's less interesting, but it does change the scenery a bit.

I got the itch to make another irc bot the other day, after installing
[one of my old ones](https://github.com/jesusabdullah/link2txtbot) to my Linode.
I'd always wanted a bot for querying [duckduckgo](http://ddg.gg)---or, at least,
as long as I've known about duckduckgo. I'm a little bit of a fanboy.

It turns out their "api" is actually really easy to use! It's pretty much the
same as a normal search querystring, except you hit a different endpoint and
you get a few extra params for choosing output style (why you wouldn't pick JSON
I don't know):

    function ddg(query, cb) {
      var url = 'http://api.duckduckgo.com/?' + qs.stringify({
        q: query,
        format: 'json',
        no_redirect: '1',
        no_html: '1'
      });
      request(url, function (err, res, body) {
        if (err) {
          return cb(err);
        }

        try {
          body = JSON.parse(body);
        }
        catch (err) {
          return cb(err);
        }

        cb(null, body, url);
      });
    };

Even better, duckduckgo supports these
[!bang commands](https://duckduckgo.com/bang.html)---**hundreds** of them, and
all I have to do to make them work is pass the received irc message in directly
to ddg:

    ddg(msg, function (err, data, url) {
      if (err) {
        client.say(to, 'ddg error: ' + err.message);
        return log.error(err.stack);
      }

      log.info('ddg: `' + msg + '` => `' + JSON.stringify(data) + '`');

The entire bot is 101 lines long, and most of it deals with pretty-printing the
received data in IRC. I find it amusing that **this bot has more valid**
**commands than lines of code.** Here are some examples I like; there are
many more.
