## It was my birthday on the 23rd.

Perhaps more interesting is who *shared* birthdays with me:

* [Joss Whedon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joss_Whedon)
* [Alan Turing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing)

That's right, we're awesome.

My girlfriend made me a german chocolate cake, and it kicked my ass. I feel like an old fart now. "Back when I was a boy I could eat TWO german chocolate cakes! Now I have one slice and I'm out for the count!" Not that this surprised her. It turns out a german chocolate cake takes 8 eggs and four sticks of butter to make. Basically, it's more fat and sugar than it is flour. Stunning.

## Scipy 2010

I'm leaving just past midnight on Sunday morning for [SciPy 2010](http://conference.scipy.org/scipy2010/index.html). It hasn't really hit me yet. Weird. Should be fun, though.

Reminds me: I wish you could do list-like comprehensions with numpy arrays. I'd love to be able to write something like this:

    A=array(fxn(i,j) for (i,j) in indices(A))

or something like this. Probably could be better, but you get the idea right? If arrays took [generators](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0289/), we'd pretty much be in business. BUT, they don't.  Maybe I'll suggest it to someone. Or, try to [improve that toy I made the other day](http://github.com/jesusabdullah/anisotropy/blob/master/extras/lcomp.py).
