#Schedules

It's been a few days since I've posted anything and don't have much to say.
Reminds me, though, of the olde ComicGenesis days, when scheduling was kind of a
Big Deal---Perhaps more so than with blogging. [Eric Burns](http://www.websnark.com)
used to talk about it a lot back in The Day.

I wonder if the scene has changed, as far as the emphasis on Getting Readers goes.
I haven't heard similar things with blogging, for example.  Maybe places like 
Reddit (and Hacker News and Digg and Twitter) have changed the landscape enough 
that retaining your readership just *isn't that important anymore.*

Then again, maybe it's just obvious.

I think like, five or six years ago, webcomics were still fresh and new, but I'm
not so sure anymore. I think a lot of people take webcomics for granted now. I
wonder if this is part of why I fell out of the community---I mean, maybe the
cutting edge bit attracted me, but now that it's moved on I've been tagging
along. Who knows?

I might as well discuss [my old webcomic](http://wholesomecoolness.comicgenesis.com)
some more.
I drew it during my junior and senior year of high school, with a 3-month buffer
at the beginning. It was a long time ago, so (naturally) it strikes me as
painfully dated and immature. Still, I spent the greater part of a year working
on it, and I like to think I learned a lot. In particular, I learned something
about taking criticism like a **man**, and something about community politics/"drama."

(For the record, I don't like the term "drama" because it automatically trivializes
what might be legitimate issues.  I also dislike "legitimate," because that makes people
try to define legitimacy, a whole nother can of worms. But sometimes you have
to bring it up.)

#Zach

Have you heard of [this guy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Anner)? My ladyfriend found his youtube channels 
([one](http://www.youtube.com/user/ZachAnner) and [two](http://www.youtube.com/user/ThatsAwesomeTV) and [three](http://www.youtube.com/user/thewingmentv))
and, well, there are lulz to be had. I'd totally watch this guy. We should watch The Wingmen.

#Life

O, u noe

But more seriously, did you hear about [that self-replicating thing for Conway's Game of Life?](http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20627653.800-first-replicating-creature-spawned-in-life-simulator.html)
Totally awesome shit. Reminded me of the days when I would play Life in Windows 3.1's
included app and not know what I was doing. I thought there was a way to *win*.
Of course, I never found it.

Anyways: Through this, I discovered [golly](http://golly.sourceforge.net/), which
is totally worth the download. Check out the [OTCAmetapixel](http://otcametapixel.blogspot.com/) demos!
(Now I want to see a metapixel implemented using metapixels. It would probably
kill any sensibly-sized computer though. I also discovered this javascript
Game of Life implementation that, tbh, kinda sucked. Kinda makes me want to write
one. Unfortunately, I'd probably do it with [processing.js](http://processingjs.org)
instead of with javascript proper, and it'd have way less features. C'est la vie?
I dunno.
