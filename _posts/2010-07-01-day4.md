##ONCE AGAIN I ACCIDENTALLY SLEPT IN

So I missed a few talks this morning. As an aside, I'm the only one here that indulges in energy drinks.

##...but I didn't miss the 0MQ talk!

Another excellent talk by Brian Granger. The hilights:

* **Py0MQ is BLAZING FAST.** XMLRPC and JSONRPC are orders of magnitude slower in terms of message throughput and latency.
* **0MQ is FAIRLY SIMPLE.** Brian likes to say it has an "afternoon-sized" API.
* **Py0MQ doesn't block the GIL.** For scientific applications, this is a BIG DEAL.

Also, here's a dead simple example showing it off:

> import zmq  
> 
> c = zmq.Context()  
> s = c.socket(zmq.REP)  
> s.bind('tcp://127.0.0.1:10001')  
> s.bind('inproc://myendpoint')  
> 
> While True:  
>     msg = s.recv()  
>     s.send(msg)  

I think this really shows off what 0MQ does well, which (in my unrefined opinion) distills message passing to a fundamental core of awesome and then wraps it up in some sexy, sexy abstractions.

The most powerful part of the presentation, though, was the live demo. Fernando Perez wrote a simple 1.5-page example, and Brian had one server broadcasting messages to three different clients, all really really quickly. Hearing "fast and simple" was great, but actually *seeing* it like that was really powerful.

For you [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) hackers out there: Do you think zeromq.js would be useful?

##Numerical Pyromaniacs: The use of Python in Fire Research.

'nuff said. Well okay, not really:

* [http://iscaliforniaonfire.com/](http://iscaliforniaonfire.com/)

* Plotting data on top of video. While I think some might find it too busy, the idea of pairing quantitative, derived data along with video of What You Would Actually See. I want to try this now.

* [BlenderFDS](http://fire.nist.gov/fds/thirdparty.html) is a pretty niche tool, but the idea of being able to export blender models for the purpose of engineering and analysis is PRETTY RAD

##[ForecastWatch](http://forecastwatch.com/)

An interesting quote (paraphrased!):

> "I would say python is more object-oriented than java, right up there with Smalltalk...Java is class-oriented, but, I mean, is an int in Java a class? No."

\*rubs chin\*

Something more useful to you and me is [Forecast Advisor](http://www.forecastadvisor.com/), since it tells you who to pay attention to regarding weather forecasts.

Something interesting you can see: Check out the accuracies of

[Fairbanks](http://www.forecastadvisor.com/Alaska/Fairbanks/99775/) vs. [Austin](http://www.forecastadvisor.com/Texas/Austin/78756/)

Some locations are easier to predict, weather-wise, than others. Perhaps interesting is that Fairbanks seems to be roughly 5% less predicatable than Austin. I wonder what accuracy data would look like if plotted on a map? Might be a good excuse to learn BeautifulSoup 

Something else that may be interesting is [Suds](https://fedorahosted.org/suds/), a fairly slick-looking SOAP library. My impression of What's Cool is not using SOAP yourself, but other people do sometimes, and Suds makes it relatively easy.

##[Madagascar](http://reproducibility.org/wiki/Package_overview)

I once took an interest in [literate programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming), but I never actually *did* it. The idea of being able to mash discussion/explanation and software implementation is definitely compelling---however, literate programming works on the assumption that the code itself is what people are truly interested in, and not merely the results. In the case of scientists running numerical simulations, this second case is usually what we're dealing with.

Madagascar tries to do this mashing without incorporating the particular philosophy of literate programming. I found that the project seems a little light on the way of tutorials (I'm a sucker for those "hello world!" tutorials that [certain projects are into](http://denied.immersedcode.org/)), and I don't know how I feel about scons ([certain other people](http://substack.net) hate on most "modern" build systems, except *maybe* [waf](http://code.google.com/p/waf/)), but I think the idea is pretty sweet. I think I'll have to try it out when I get home.

##[Statsmodels](http://scikits.appspot.com/statsmodels)

The presenter, Skipper Seabold, is a [GSOC](http://scipystats.blogspot.com/) participant.

The thing that popped out for me is SimpleTable, which is a component that outputs tabular data as multiple formats including LaTeX. This sounds pretty awesome.  I'd like to see it mashed up with, perhaps, [Elaine's tabular](http://parsemydata.com/tabular/) if it doesn't already have this functionality. Skipper signed up for the interpolation sprint, and I can kinda see why. I wasn't particularly interested in this sprint, but after seeing that there has been some work out there on it, I'm starting to think that trying my hand at this tomorrow could be pretty rad!

Aside from this, I'm mostly learning just how unfamiliar I am with stats. Sad! If I stay in school until next Spring, I'm totally taking stats.

##[pandas](http://pandas.sourceforge.net/)

Pandas gives you some labeled datatypes, similar to R's dataframes.

That settles it. There is definitely demand for some kind of awesome tabular datatype. In fact, there is a "Birds of a Feather" meeting on it tonight that I'm going to attend. Shit could be sweet.

## A Digression

SciPy is a total sausagefest. I'm *really* not here for the ladies since I [totally have a sweetie back home](http://lishua.blogspot.com), but even I'm gonna comment when I notice that there are maybe 4 women in a group of roughly 150 men.

> [josh@pidgey _posts]$ python -c'print 4./150.'

*awesome.* ;)
