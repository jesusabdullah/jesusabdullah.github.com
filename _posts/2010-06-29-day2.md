(Incidentally, I wish Flickr would give me markdown, etc. in addition to stupid html. Is there a greasemonkey script for that? Anyways---)

I met Jenni back in [science camp](http://www.nysc.org) the summer after I graduated from high school, and it turns out she lives right here in Austin! She seems to appreciate having company from far off places, and has been giving me hookups on good eats the last few days. Also, a ride from the airport. Thanks Jenni!

## <s>PyCUDA</s>Cafe Medici

I missed this tutorial. I swear my alarm went off at 7:00, and I looked away for a second, [*just one friggin' second,*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0r7syc1BSg#t=3m19s) and suddenly it was 8:30. Weak!

So, I took the opportunity to try out Medici's. I have to say, they make a good cup. It's way more mellow than I'm used to, though.

This is how I tend to think of coffee:

Medici's coffee, on the other hand, is a *gentle lover*.
