##I Did Something Stupid This Morning

I gave a homeless dude a dollar.

In my defense, I didn't know he was homeless at first. He talked to me like a
(mostly) normal person before we caught the same BART train, and made small
talk on the way. Then, he said that he was worried about being short on bus
fare.  I obviously shouldn't have been suckered in by this at all. However,
if this happened in Fairbanks it would have a much greater chance of being
legit. In fact, it *did* happen to me once.  This guy, who was obviously
*not* homeless, had forgotten his wallet, and it was cold out. He was really
nice, didn't expect anything, and when I did happen to have change he thanked
me and everything. If I was suckered by *this* guy, at least it wasn't too
terrible an experience.

So, that's what I was thinking when I gave this guy the time of day.

When he started saying, "five to stay alive," any red flags that hadn't been
triggered should've gone up, but I guess I was just being slow. So, figuring
that, if he were truly short on bus fare, that a dollar would probably get him
going, I gave him a dollar.

That's when he started getting pushy. "Naw man gimme the five!"

"I don't *have* a five!" I said.  This was probably trpue. Luckily for me,
a Good Samaritan saved the day by telling the guy to piss off for me (for which
 I am really grateful).  Later, another guy informed me that I "shouldn't give
them money---It makes them bolder."

A little late. Oh well.

## I Forgot About Proprietary Attitudes in Academia Again

I had a guy remind me of this while taking pictures of his poster. Nothing bad
happened or anything---he just reminded me that he was planning to publish,
and then he explained his (pretty cool) poster to me. But, to be honest, I
*did* forget.

In a sense, I make a terrible academic. I like researching and
everything, but I always forget to take into account this sort of thing. As a
native Netizen, I have this in-built base assumption that anything being
shown to me is meant to be shared. This is very different from
academia, where the base assumption is that it's a secret between you and the
presenter. That is, the assumption is that you're peer review and are secretly
*previewing* the material so that they can be prepared to meet any common
criticisms.

For me, at least, it's weird.

Anyways: As a consequence, I'm taking down the Flickr pictures of the posters
from yesterday. Sorry!
