In Alaska, it's primary season right now. People are lobbying and campaigning left and right!

Including, [these people](http://alaskaseconomy.org/), aka First National Bank of Alaska.

Now, I'm cool with championing a strong economy. At least it's an issue that matters in the end, right? Nobody likes a shitty economy.

However, I want to direct your attention to...**the stool.** In particular, look at the **legs.** Too lazy to click the link? Here's their list of the three sectors that Alaska's economy depends on (a la the legs of a stool):

* Oil
* The Federal Government
* "Other"

What kind of bullshit legs are those? I'm just saying, that's a shitty stool.
