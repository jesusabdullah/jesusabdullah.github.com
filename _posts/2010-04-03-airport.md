Whew, long week. I'm beat. This sucks, because I'm actually kinda excited right
now about Hacking Shit. In turn, this is kinda funny because I'm more of a
kludger than a hacker. ;)

It's funny how reliant I've gotten on the internet. Austin's airport (where I am
right now) doesn't have free wifi---just some Boingo bullshit that redirected
each and every one of my browser tabs. :( It's not that I'm necessarily addicted
to the blogoblag, though. See, I keep trying to work on some of my little
projects, and I find I need to look up some api or module in order to do
anything useful! It's definitely mildly frustrating.

On the plus side, you guys won't be flooded with my git pushes. 
Sorry about that. I really am.

I think I'm gonna try to sleep on the airplane, maybe. And then use Denver's
wifi if they have it. Man, I'll be glad to be home.
