Loren Ipsum? :v

It's been a while since I've done any real blogging, and my web page has always
sucked, but that's okay! I'm gonna try to write something relatively often now.
We'll see how it goes!

Anyways.

Let's talk about the new webpage, maybe?

I used [blueprint](http://www.blueprintcss.org/) as a css framework, and that
made things like automatically beautiful. I should really try to customize 
things, but I don't really care right now! UNFORTUNATE. When I do, I'll 
probably think colors a little, make the toplinks prettier, and maybe even
bust out some [Franchise Bold](http://derekweathersbee.com/franchise/). 
At any rate, that was by far the easiest time I've had with making a web site.
I approve! I'm also glad, however, that I'm not a web designer. It's really
just not my gig.

This web site uses [jekyll](http://wiki.github.com/mojombo/jekyll/) to process
everything. Part of that is because github has that standard, but it also
turns out that this, in the end, was pretty much what I wanted. Now I can just
write blog posts in [markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), 
save and push to my github repo, and *magic happens*. Total win. Now I just
have to get the LaTeX math extensions rockin' and I'm set for life.
