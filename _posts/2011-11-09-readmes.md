title: How To Write A Readme
---

So you're writing a module. Cool! Are you ready to document it? I'm here to help.

I'm no expert on readmes. I have, however, read a *lot* of readmes (both good and bad), written my fair share of readmes and documentation, and---most importantly---have formed strong opinions on what I should see in a readme.

This post focuses on the "first pass" for your readme. These PROTIPS are applicable, however, to readmes of *all* ages.

## 1. Write an Example, Right Now

The very first thing that should be written in a readme is a short example code snippet. This snippet should show what your library does, and as little else as possible. In the ideal case, people should *be able to infer from your example how your library works*.

For example, here's a stubbed-out readme for a small utility by [SubStack](https://github.com/substack/node-mkdirp):

> mkdirp
> ======

> Like `mkdir -p`, but in node.js!
> 
> Example
> =======
> 
> pow.js
> ------
>     var mkdirp = require('mkdirp');
        
>     mkdirp('/tmp/foo/bar/baz', 0755, function (err) {
>         if (err) console.error(err)
>         else console.log('pow!')
>     });
> 
> Output
>     pow!
> 
> And now /tmp/foo/bar/baz exists, huzzah!

This probably isn't the greatest readme of all time. However, the example is a perfect case study. In **four lines**, a programmer more or less fluent in javascript can tell that `mkdirp`:

* Is a function.
* Takes 3 arguments:
    * file path
    * octal permissions
    * An errorback
* Probably makes directories.

Add in the mention of "like mkdir -p" and, without any other documentation, we can tell how it works.

Of course, mkdir -p is small enough that you can actually cover 100% of the API in one example. Not all projects are so lucky, but they can still strive to get a common use case across.

Here's another good example of an example, from [node-tap](https://github.com/isaacs/node-tap). The example in this code saves what would otherwise be a terrible readme, to the point where node-tap has a solid contingent of loyal users *despite* its readme.

### Why?

You want to get people to use your project, right? Supposing this is your goal, you have to understand that **your readme is your library's best chance of "selling" your library**, and you **don't have that much time**.

When a developer starts looking at libraries that might solve his or her problem, they're thinking two things:

1. Does this project solve my problem?
2. If so, how?

Chances are they're looking at your project's competition as well, and they're not very patient. You need to get the gist of this information across early enough that your audience pauses to read the rest of your readme.

A *good* example will tell a developer right away if the module does what they need, and *any* example will give the developer a taste of your API.

You also get the added benefit of having to write a simple case of your API, giving you the opportunity to "sanity check" your API. Does anything look bulky in your example? Could the API be made more obvious? Now you know.

## 2. Describe the install procedure.

A project that I think does a really good job of this is [hook.io](https://github.com/hookio/hook.io):

> # Getting Start / Demo
> 
>      npm install hook.io-helloworld -g
> 
> Now run:
> 
>      hookio-helloworld
> 
> 
> Spawn up as many as you want. The first one becomes a server, the rest will become clients. Each helloworld hook emits a hello on an interval. Now watch the i/o party go!

**Two. Lines.** You now know how to get up and going with hook.io!

Node.js projects like hook.io are lucky in this regard, as npm makes most installations for node projects a one-liner. This is ideal, as ease of installation is another selling point for your project.

If you're not lucky enough to have an easy installation procedure, then this section becomes even more important. In the case of hook.io, I may have been able to put 2 and 2 together and went looking for it on npm. For a more complicated yet poorly-documented install procedure, developers *will* screw it up, at which point they will either complain to you or give up and move on.

### Why?

Assuming your example made a sale, the second question a developer is going to ask is, "How do I install this thing?" Make it easy for them.

## 3. Stub out the API docs.

Now that you have a basic example and installation instructions, you can move on to documenting the basic API.

When I write API docs (and this is admittedly a weak point for me), I like to start with obvious entry points (your module only has one obvious entry point, right?) and work from there.

For example, here's a snippet from some API docs I wrote for [union](https://github.com/flatiron/union):

> ### union.createServer(options)
> 
> The `options` object is required. Options include:
> 
> #### options.before
> 
> `options.before` is an array of middlewares, which are used to route and serve incoming requests. For instance, in the example, `favicon` is a middleware which handles requests for `/favicon.ico`.
> 
> Union's request handling is [connect](https://github.com/senchalabs/connect)-compatible, meaning that all existing connect middlewares should work out-of-the-box with union.
> 
> In addition, the response object passed to middlewares listens for a "next" event, which is equivalent to calling `next()`. Flatiron middlewares are written in this manner, meaning they are not reverse-compatible with connect.
> 
> #### options.after
> 
> `options.after` is an array of stream filters, which are applied after the request handlers in `options.before`. Stream filters inherit from `union.ResponseStream`, which implements the Node.js core streams api with a bunch of other goodies.
> 
> The advantage to streaming middlewares is that they do not require buffering the entire stream in order to execute their function.
> 
> #### options.limit (*optional*)
> 
> This argument is passed to internal instantiations of `union.BufferedStream`.
>

In union, the obvious entry point is `union.createServer`. In this example, I tried to explain what you do with it, and what all the pieces mean.

### Why?

Hopefully the idea of *documenting your code* isn't completely foreign. That said, you may be tempted to think that an example is "enough". I would suggest that this is true only in very rare cases. Even `mkdirp` could use a short paragraph explaining the arguments and behavior of the module. Inferrence is great, but shouldn't be completely relied upon. Be straightforward.

## 4. Tests

Your module may or may not have tests. If it *does* have tests (and tests are a wonderful idea!), you should describe how to run them. For example, here's a snippet that's very familiar to us at Nodejitsu:

> ## Run Tests
> Tests are written in vows and give complete coverage of all APIs and storage engines.
> 
> ``` bash
>   $ npm test
> ```

This is pretty much ideal.

### Why?

Like installation instructions, testing directions should be as straightforward as possible. If you're using node and npm, npm test is great because it distills testing into a one-liner.

(Choosing the *right* testing framework is another discussion entirely. I personally like node-tap).

## 5. Licensing and Contributors

Finally, tag on your license and contributors.

The content of this *isn't actually too important* in the context of a readme. For example, I usually just write the following:

> ## License:
>
> MIT/X11.

### Why?

It's a good idea to tell other people how they can/may work on your code of course, but it's a secondary consideration. First, your commit logs will show who worked on the project, and arguably way better than your readme can. Second, the license is only important for people that want to hack on your code, and even then most people are willing to accept "It's MIT" when it comes to sending a pull request.

Licensing may become more important in the future, but in the short term you can afford to wait and scale it later.

## 6. But I had other stuff to say!

Write a blog post about it.

No, seriously.

### Why?

A readme isn't always the best place to talk about your project. A readme's scope should really be pretty limited to:

* What is it?
* How do I use it?

Anything else---like, "Why I Wrote This Module" or "Addressing Criticisms Of My Module"---don't really fit. But, blog posts are a **great** way of getting this information out.

A good example of how a blog post can enhance a readme can be found on Nodejitsu's blog:

> [Scaling Isomorphic Javascript Code](http://blog.nodejitsu.com/scaling-isomorphic-javascript-code)

In this blog post, Charlie Robbins discusses the motivations behind writing [flatiron](https://github.com/flatiron/flatiron), Nodejitsu's collective idea of what a web framework should look like.

For those interested in design patterns, it's a very good read. In this post, Charlie distills the meaning of MVC, how different existing frameworks implement it, and why (in his opinion) existing tools aren't enough. If that lights your fire, then I highly recommend this article.

That said, for the user that just wants to write a webapp and doesn't really care about which kind of MVC-ish paradigm they're using, such explanations in a readme will **only get in the way.**

# TL;DR

If nothing else, **write an example.**
